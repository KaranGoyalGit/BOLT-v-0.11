# BOLT-v-0.11
This is open source code for Bolt. Bolt is a basic programming language developed by Karan Goyal. Its simple syntax makes it extremely easy to learn. Bolt is only focused for people to get a better grasp to complex programming language by first understanding a programming language so amazing and simple as Bolt. If you are struggling to get your head around complex topics like loops, if and else statements and functions, this is the right language for you. But it has some drawbacks: it can't be used for any kind of software development. It has not got even one library or module(not till now) as it is for only a basic understanding of programming. By Creator, Karan Goyal.
