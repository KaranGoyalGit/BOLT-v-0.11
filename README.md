Bolt is a basic programming language developed by Karan Goyal. 
It's easy and simple syntax make it extremely easy to learn.
Bolt is only focused for people to get a better grasp to complex programming language by first understanding a programming language so amazing and simple as Bolt. 
If you are struggling to get your head around complex topics like loops, if and else statements and functions, This is the right language for you. 
But is has some drawbacks, it can't be used for any kind of software development. It has not got even one library or module(not till now) as it is for only basics understanding of programming, and it not a object oriented programming language. By Creator, Karan Goyal.
